ALL THE COMMANDS THAT ARE NEEDED ON TERMINAL
 To create  a new user from the terminal we can use the command
 sudo useradd <username>
           ex: sudo useradd tarun

To enter into that user we use the command  
 sudo su <username>
            ex: Sudo su Tarun
After the creation of the user, we need to permit user in order to add anything to the user
For that, we enter a command
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
          ex: sudo usermod -aG Tarun

we can check the permissions of the user by the command
groups <username>
         ex: groups tarun
         output=> tarun : tarun sudo

Docker-compose. YAML file 

The docker-compose.YAML file consists of mainly three fields

{

FROM --Indicates the sources from which we are importing the docker image

RUN --This command gets executed while we are building the docker build to add all the dependencies required by the application we are working with.

CMD -- These are the commands that get executed after the docker file is built and whenever we run the docker image file 

}

 

Best practices while writing docker-images:

Always use the official image from the docker hub repository 

Mention the version of the file that we are going to import rather than: the latest tag so that we won't have dependencies version issues

Never export any ports that weren't used or not needed to have fewer vulnerability issues 

Use a .dockerignore file to remove or exclude all the unnecessary files into docker every time while doing the update 

 

  Always make layers so that the layers that weren't changed at first because docker uses caching and stores all the layers in the local memory and if a layer is changed then all the layers above the changed layers become void and not usable so sorting layers is must while dockerfile creation

 

Use multi-stage building whenever there is a scope to create the whole application from a dockerfile and then copy the file into another file and with the fewer dependencies run the latest docker image file

Using of docker scan to find out the vulnerabilities of the docker image 

Use environment variables in another file and import rather than hard-coding the username and passwords 

create a non-root user and run everything inside the new user and group so that the implementations we do won't be in the root user to have a fewer vulnerability issues

Use of docker secret service to protect the fields such as ssh keys or authentication passwords because they shouldn't be stored as plain text as they are harm to security
